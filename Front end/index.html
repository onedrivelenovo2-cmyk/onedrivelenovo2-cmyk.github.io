			<h1>Welcome to planet Earth!</h1>
			<p><i><b>Planet Earth is the third planet from the Sun, a rocky world uniquely known for supporting life, featuring liquid water, a 			life-sustaining oxygen-rich atmosphere, and a dynamic surface shaped by tectonic plates and water. It's the fifth-largest planet, an 			"ocean world" with over 70% covered by water, and protected by a magnetic field and atmosphere that shield it from most solar 				radiation.</i></b></p>
